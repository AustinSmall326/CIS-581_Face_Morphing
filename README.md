Overview:
------------------
This project focused on image morphing techniques.  The goal of this project was to create a "morph" animation of my face into another person's face.  A morph is a simultaneous warp of the image shape and a cross-dissolve of the image colors.  

In this project, I implement two morphing methods (point triangulation and thin plate spline).  The techniques utilized in this project were referenced from the following sources.
